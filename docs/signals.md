| `breakout_52w` | WR 35%, avg −1.5% in BULL_TREND (its only firing regime); consistently negative | v1.x |
| `vix_fear_reversion` | Zero trades in all backtest runs; never fires in practice | v1.x |
| `rs_leader` | Standalone Sharpe −0.93 over 9-year walk-forward; no edge at any param threshold | v1.x |
| `momentum_12_1` | WR 48%, avg −0.2% in every tested regime; ΔSharpe +0.08 from removal | v1.x |
| `range_reversion` | 2 trades in combined production backtest, WR 0%, avg −16.2%; backward elimination Step 3 (ΔSharpe +0.04); conditions too restrictive to fire reliably | v1.98 |

## Fundamental quality gates

Applied before signal evaluation; block specific signals when conditions are met.

| Gate | Condition | Signals blocked |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| Altman Z distress | Z < 1.1 | All trend/breakout/momentum longs (`_DISTRESS_BLOCKED`) |
| Piotroski quality | F < 3 | `pead`, `insider_buying` |
| Forward P/E expensive | P/E > 60 | `momentum`, `macd_crossover`, `gap_and_go`, `bb_squeeze`, `inside_day_breakout`, `trend_pullback` |
| Gross margin deterioration | GM trend < −3pp | `pead`, `guidance_raise_signal`, `trend_pullback` |
| Accruals quality | Accruals ratio > 0.10 | Same set as forward P/E expensive |

## Short signals

Active short signals (regime-gated: STRESS_RISK_OFF, HIGH_VOL_DOWNTREND, DEFENSIVE_DOWNTREND, CREDIT_STRESS only).

| Signal | Entry conditions |
|--------|-----------------|
| `post_earnings_gapdown_failed_bounce` | Recent ≥7% earnings/news gap-down whose low is subsequently broken (the reflexive bounce failed) + vol_ratio ≥ 1.5 — negative-PEAD continuation entered *after* the bounce, not on the gap bar. Computed live in `scan_short_universe`; the one short with a documented short-horizon edge. |
| `earnings_gap_down` | Post-earnings gap down ≥ 7% with vol_ratio ≥ 2.5 — naive gap-day negative PEAD (superseded live by the failed-bounce variant above) |
| `piotroski_distress_short` | Piotroski F ≤ 2 + price below SMA200 |
| `accruals_quality_short` | Accruals ratio > 0.15 + ret_5d > 5% (extended price) |
| `lockup_expiry_short` | IPO lockup expires in 5–10 calendar days |
| `analyst_downgrade_signal` | Consensus shift from Buy toward Hold/Sell |
| `accounting_concern_short` | An 8-K restatement, non-reliance, or auditor change (EDGAR) — a hard governance red flag. RS-rank agnostic (catalyst path) |
| `insider_selling_short` | Cluster of ≥3 distinct insiders selling open-market (Form 4 code 'S') — informed distribution. RS-rank agnostic |
| `index_deletion_short` | Name removed from a major index (news-detected) — forced index-fund selling into the effective date. RS-rank agnostic |
| `eps_revision_down_short` | ≥3 downward current-quarter EPS estimate revisions (last 30d) that outnumber raises — the estimate-revision anomaly (cuts precede negative drift). RS-rank agnostic |
| `guidance_downgrade` | Negative 8-K guidance — management lowering outlook. RS-rank agnostic |
| `secondary_offering_short` | 424B4/S-3 secondary prospectus — dilution / supply shock. RS-rank agnostic |

The catalyst shorts (`accounting_concern_short`, `insider_selling_short`, `index_deletion_short`,
`eps_revision_down_short`, `analyst_downgrade_signal`, `guidance_downgrade`, `secondary_offering_short`)
are flag-driven corporate events surfaced regardless of RS rank (ADR-006 Tier-1): the short snapshots
are now enriched with the same EDGAR + Form-4 + analyst-revision feeds the long side uses (the
analyst-revision feed was previously never wired into the pipeline at all). They are not backtestable
(no historical point-in-time event feed) and ship live on forward-evidence, gated by the AI veto (B2).
`index_deletion_short` coverage is currently
limited to names with headlines in the long-side news set.

### Borrow cost & hard-to-borrow gate

Every short is now priced against an estimated annualized stock-borrow rate (`data/borrow_cost.py`), derived from short-interest tiers since no paid cost-to-borrow feed is available:

| short % of float | Estimated borrow rate | Tier |
|------------------|----------------------|------|
| < 5% | 0.5% | general collateral |
| 5–15% | 3% | moderate |
| 15–30% | 10% | elevated |
| 30–50% | 30% | hard-to-borrow (skipped live) |
| > 50% | 80% | special / often unborrowable |

- **Backtest**: borrow cost is netted from short P&L at every cover (the combined production backtest derives rates from the short-interest data it fetches). Prior to v1.99, short backtests modelled borrow as free and overstated short returns.
- **Live**: `_execute_shorts` skips hard-to-borrow names (rate ≥ 30%) and records `borrow_rate_annual` on every short.

### Index regime hedge (opt-in)

`_execute_index_hedge` shorts an index ETF (`INDEX_HEDGE_SYMBOL`, default SPY) at `INDEX_HEDGE_WEIGHT` of the portfolio when the regime is in `INDEX_HEDGE_REGIMES` (default STRESS_RISK_OFF, HIGH_VOL_DOWNTREND), and covers when the regime exits. Index ETFs borrow cheap, are deeply liquid, and carry no single-name squeeze risk — a structurally cleaner short than crowded single names. **Disabled by default** (`INDEX_HEDGE_ENABLED`): it is a live order path and must be explicitly opted into; it honours `dry_run`/`_live_shadow`. The backtest overlay (`compute_index_hedge_pnl`) reports the hedge's P&L contribution as `result["index_hedge"]`.

### Disabled short signals

The short book's core problem is that most short signals are *confirming* indicators, not *predictive* ones: by the time they fire, the market has already shorted the name. The lagging fundamental shorts below also encode multi-month theses that cannot resolve inside our 1–5 day hold. Disabled pending a rebuild around catalyst-anchored shorts + an index regime hedge (and a borrow-cost model, which we currently lack).

| Signal | Reason | Disabled |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `death_cross` | SMA50/200 cross fires ~15–30% into a decline; WR 32% (n=25) / 40% (n=121). Lagging confirmation. | v1.99 |
| `altman_distress_short` | Distress is a quarters-long thesis; 337 trades WR 45% avg −0.17% in a 3-day hold (wrong horizon, entered after credit desks). | v1.99 |
| `gross_margin_deterioration_short` | Slow fundamental; 5 trades, WR 40%, avg −1.32%. Too few to validate, worst avg of the trio. | v1.99 |
| `earnings_miss`, `ema_breakdown`, `rs_deterioration`, `faded_earnings_gap_up`, `overbought_downtrend`, `parabolic_exhaustion`, `failed_breakout`, `high_vol_reversal`, `winner_reversal` | Negative expectancy across all isolation/backward-elimination runs (see `SHORT_GLOBALLY_DISABLED` in `signals/evaluator.py`). | v1.x–v1.80 |
| `iv_compression_short`, `candle_exhaustion_short`, `obv_divergence_short`, `obv_acceleration_short`, `volume_climax_reversal_short` | New short signals disabled pending initial backtest validation. | v1.82–v1.94 |

> **Note on borrow cost:** no short backtest currently models stock-borrow cost, so all historical short results are optimistic. A borrow-cost model is the prerequisite for the planned short-book rebuild (`post_earnings_gapdown_failed_bounce` + `index_regime_hedge`).
