## Globally disabled signals

| Signal | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| `rsi_divergence` | WR 48%, avg −0.9% in NEUTRAL_CHOP (75% of its trades); Sharpe drag in every run |
| `breakout_52w` | WR 35%, avg −1.5% in BULL_TREND (its only firing regime); consistently negative |
| `vix_fear_reversion` | Zero trades in all backtest runs; never fires in practice |
| `rs_leader` | Standalone Sharpe −0.93 over 9-year walk-forward; no edge at any param threshold |
| `momentum_12_1` | WR 48%, avg −0.2% in every tested regime; ΔSharpe +0.08 from removal |
